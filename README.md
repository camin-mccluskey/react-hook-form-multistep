# React Hook Form Multi-Step

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-hook-form-multistep.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-hook-form-multistep)

Create react-hook-forms with multistep functionality.

- ✅ Bring your existing forms using react-hook-form.
- 🚶 Use the stepper component to visualise form progress (or bring your own).
- 💾 Save the state of your form as the user progresses.
- ⛔️ Provides feedback when the form is in invalid state, blocking progress.
- 📃 Unstyled. As this is just a wrapper around your own forms.
